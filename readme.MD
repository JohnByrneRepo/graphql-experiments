GraphQL
-------

From the GraphQL website:

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

GraphQL Tag
-----------

Helpful utilities for parsing GraphQL queries. Includes:

`gql` A JavaScript template literal tag that parses GraphQL query strings into the standard GraphQL AST.
`loader` A webpack loader to preprocess queries

graphql-tag uses the reference graphql library under the hood as a peer dependency so in addition to installing this module, you'll also have to install graphql-js.


GraphQL Yoga
------------

ðŸ§˜ Fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience
