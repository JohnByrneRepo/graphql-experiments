GraphQL
-------

From the GraphQL website:

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

GraphQL Tag
-----------

Helpful utilities for parsing GraphQL queries. Includes:

`gql` A JavaScript template literal tag that parses GraphQL query strings into the standard GraphQL AST.
`loader` A webpack loader to preprocess queries

graphql-tag uses the reference graphql library under the hood as a peer dependency so in addition to installing this module, you'll also have to install graphql-js.

GraphQL Yoga
------------

ðŸ§˜ Fully-featured GraphQL Server with focus on easy setup, performance & great developer experience

Experiments
-----------

*01-graph-ql* - The example Query taken from the JavaScript section of the GraphQL website, and some other more advanced examples

*02-graphql-playground* - An example of using GraphQL playground to test a query in the browser, including the autocompletion and syntax highlighting that it provides

*03-graphql-express* - An example of building a schema and resolvers in GraphQL with an Express server

*04-graphql-tag* - An example of using the `gql` tag

*05-graph-ql-yoga* - The example Query taken from the `graphql-yoga` github readme, to show how a basic server can be constructed using this add-on library

To-do:

*05-graphql-schemas* - An analysis of what is a schema in GraphQL terminology and an example of validating a schema using GraphQL's validation methods

*06-graphql-type-definitions* - An analysis of GraphQl types, including `scalar`, `object`, `interface`, `union`, `enum`, `input object`, `list` and `non-null` types 

*07-graphql-scalars* - Examples of how scalar types are used in GraphQL, including 
`GraphQLFloat`, `GraphQLString`, `GraphQLBoolean` and `GraphQLID`
